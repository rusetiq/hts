### 1. Convert Sentence to Cow Latin

You are given a sentence `s` consisting of words separated by single spaces. Convert the sentence to **Cow Latin** using the following rules:

1. If a word begins with a **vowel** (`a, e, i, o, u`, case-insensitive), append `"moo"` to the end of the word.  
2. If a word begins with a **consonant**, move the first letter to the end of the word, then append `"moo"`.  
3. Add one letter `"m"` to the end of the word for each word index (starting from `1`).  
4. The words in the final sentence should be separated by single spaces.  
5. There should be no leading or trailing spaces in the final result.

- `"love"` → starts with consonant → `"ove" + "l" + "moo" + "mm"` → `"lovemoomm"`  
- `"milk"` → starts with consonant → `"ilk" + "m" + "moo" + "mmm"` → `"ilkmmoomm"`
