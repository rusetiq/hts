### 2. Tallest Milk Fence

You are given an integer array `heights` where each element represents the height of a vertical fence post.  
Two fence posts can hold up a **stretch of milk fabric** between them. Return the **maximum milk** that can be held between any two fence posts.

---

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`heights = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`

**Output:**  
`49`

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`heights = [1,1]`

**Output:**  
`1`

---

### Constraints:

- `2 <= heights.length <= 10^5`  
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

### Test Cases for "Tallest Milk Fence"

| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Explanation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]` | `49` | Example 1 from prompt; max area between posts 8 and 7 |
| 2 | `[1,1]` | `1` | Example 2 from prompt; only two posts |
| 3 | `[4,3,2,1,4]` | `16` | Max area between first 4 and last 4 → `min(4,4)*(4-0)=16` |
| 4 | `[1,2,1]` | `2` | Max area between posts 1 and 2 → `min(1,1)*(2-0)=2` |
| 5 | `[1,2,4,3]` | `4` | Max area between 4 and 3 → `min(4,3)*(3-2)=3`? Wait, better 2 and 4 → min(2,4)*(2-1)=2, so 4 and 3 → min(4,3)*(3-2)=3, better 1 and 3 → min(1,3)*(3-0)=3, best 2 and 3? Actually max is 4*1=4 between 4 and 3? Yes | `4` |
| 6 | `[6,9,3,4,5,8]` | `32` | Max area between 6 and 8 → `min(6,8)*(5-0)=6*5=30`? Better 9 and 8 → `min(9,8)*(5-1)=8*4=32` |
| 7 | `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` | `25` | Max area between 5 and 10 → `min(5,10)*(9-4)=5*5=25` |
| 8 | `[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]` | `25` | Max area between 10 and 6 → `min(10,6)*(5-0)=6*5=30`? Better 10 and 5 → 5*5=25? Actually 10 and 5 →5*5=25, yes. |
| 9 | `[1,3,2,5,25,24,5]` | `24` | Max area between 5 (index 3) and 5 (index 6) → min(5,5)*(6-3)=5*3=15? Better 25 and 24 → min(25,24)*(5-4)=24*1=24 | `24` |
| 10 | `[2,3,10,5,7,8,9]` | `36` | Max area between 10 (index 2) and 9 (index 6) → min(10,9)*(6-2)=9*4=36 |
