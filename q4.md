### 4. Midnight Library Challenge

You are the keeper of a mystical library that only opens at midnight. Each book in the library contains a **riddle**, and solving a riddle gives you a **key**.  
You can only pick **one riddle at a time**, and each riddle may require a different number of minutes to solve.  

Given a total of `T` minutes before the library closes, determine the **maximum number of riddles** you can solve if you choose them optimally.

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`riddles = [5, 10, 3, 7], T = 15`

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**  
- Solve riddles with times 3, 5, and 7 → total 15 minutes → maximum number of riddles = 3.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`riddles = [4, 2, 8, 6], T = 10`

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**  
- Solve riddles with times 2, 4, and 4 (or 6,2,2 if repeated) → maximum riddles = 3.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= riddles.length <= 1000`  
- `1 <= riddles[i] <= 100`  
- `1 <= T <= 10000`
