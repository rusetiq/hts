### 4. Midnight Library Challenge

You are the keeper of a mystical library that only opens at midnight. Each book in the library contains a **riddle**, and solving a riddle gives you a **key**.  
You can only pick **one riddle at a time**, and each riddle may require a different number of minutes to solve.  

Given a total of `T` minutes before the library closes, determine the **maximum number of riddles** you can solve if you choose them optimally.

---

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`riddles = [5, 10, 3, 7], T = 15`

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**  
- Solve riddles with times 3, 5, and 7 → total 15 minutes → maximum number of riddles = 3.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`riddles = [4, 2, 8, 6], T = 10`

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**  
- Solve riddles with times 2, 4, and 4 (or 6,2,2 if repeated) → maximum riddles = 3.

---

### Constraints:

- `1 <= riddles.length <= 1000`  
- `1 <= riddles[i] <= 100`  
- `1 <= T <= 10000`

### Test Cases for "Midnight Library Challenge"

| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Explanation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | `riddles = [5, 10, 3, 7], T = 15` | `3` | Example 1 from prompt; pick 3, 5, 7 |
| 2 | `riddles = [4, 2, 8, 6], T = 10` | `3` | Example 2 from prompt; pick 2, 4, 4 or 2,4,4 |
| 3 | `riddles = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], T = 10` | `4` | Pick 1,2,3,4 → total 10 minutes |
| 4 | `riddles = [10, 20, 30], T = 15` | `1` | Only 10 can be picked |
| 5 | `riddles = [5,5,5,5], T = 20` | `4` | All four riddles can be solved |
| 6 | `riddles = [7,3,2,1], T = 5` | `3` | Pick 1,2,3 → total 6 exceeds T, so pick 1,2 → 3? Actually pick 1,2 → 3? | Max riddles = 2 | Corrected | `2` |
| 7 | `riddles = [100,200,50,30], T = 150` | `2` | Pick 50 and 30 → total 80? Can we pick 100+50=150? Max riddles = 2 |
| 8 | `riddles = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], T = 3` | `3` | Pick any three 1-minute riddles |
| 9 | `riddles = [5,10,15], T = 5` | `1` | Only 5-minute riddle can be picked |
| 10 | `riddles = [2,3,2,3,2], T = 7` | `3` | Pick 2,2,3 → total 7 minutes |
